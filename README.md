This is an opensource World of Warcraft interrupt bot.

This tool is for learning purposes and injection method is probably unsafe for live servers.

Injection part was made for World of Warcraft 4.3.4 (x86 and DX9 only !) but can be updated for latest versions in Offsets.cs, also the hooking method will not work for windows 8 unless you update the injection.
